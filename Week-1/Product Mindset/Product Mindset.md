According to me, the Product mindset is about building a product-centric thought process rather than a temporary milestone-based release approach. Itâ€™s about being ruthlessly user centric with the decision-making guided by insights including user research and user behavioral data. It's about solving user/customer problems and measuring success on impact.  The higher focus is on the business and the end product; the objective of customer centricity strongly emerges. And to achieve this goal of customer savvy product; the entire team works together for the same vision.

We think about customers first, and then start product discovery by asking questions:
What do the users want? What are they trying to achieve? Does the product help them do this?
Can they use the product? Are they using it as expected?
Is it technically feasible for us to deliver (and maintain) it?
Is there a viable business model to support it?
