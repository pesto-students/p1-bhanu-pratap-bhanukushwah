1. Considering all kinds of vehicles travelling on a road, the optimal solution has been thought by dividing the types of vehicles that can move on a certain road in specific time zones.
2.  The schools and colleges are usually open from 6AM to 10AM(for taking students to schools/colleges) and from 3pm to 5PM(for dropping them at their respective bus stops)
3. The public buses stopping on the main road often creates a lot of traffic. Also the school and college buses create a lot of hassle on the roads, considering the number of schools and colleges in a city.
4. Keeping in mind the above problems, the following system can be implemented:
     i. All the vehicles can travel in lane 1,2, 5 and 6.
     ii. During the school and college commute hours(6AM to 10AM and 3PM to 5PM), only the college and school buses can go through the lanes 5,6. This would assure there is no increase of traffic and the vehicles can easily go from lanes 1,2,5, and 6.
     iii. school and college students can take their buses from the bus stop built inside lane 3,4.
     iv. in the non-school and college hours, only four wheelers are allowed to enter lane 3 and 4 to ensure easy traffic management in other lanes. Though the four wheelers can from other lanes as well.
     v. 1 bus stop is made for each straight perpendicular line for the public places. The stop is made as an extension so for the pedestrians and the disabled can take their time getting into the buses without disrupting the traffic.
     vi. A footpath is also made along the sides for the pedestrians and the disabled people who do not have a vehicle. The zebra crossing is made at the main square where they can switch lanes.
     vii. The traffic lights can be used to indicate when the vehicles can move and when the pedestrians can use zebra crossing.
